## Brief review of the video lectures

- In the video lectures related to this session we give a brief introduction to the main functionality of Git and Github. 

### Git

- Git is an open source, light-weight, and powerful system for *version control*. 
- Git keeps track of the state of all the files in a project over time and works essentially as a time machine. We can easily navigate the history of the entire project and return to an earlier point if needed.
- Git lets us work on several *branches*. This lets us develop experimental features without touching a working/stable project, which can be merged into the main branch when tested and ready.
- Git comes with tools for handling merge conflicts.

### Github

- Online (commercial, owned by Microsoft) service hosting git repositories.
- Comes with additional features such as *project management and team collaboration*, *releases*, *forks* and *pull requests*.
- There are alternatives, most notably **GitLab** which is in orbit around (but not owned by) Google.
